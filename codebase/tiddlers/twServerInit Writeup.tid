This function will check the [[twOutput|Config Docs]] directory and if required will initialize a new server edition `tiddlywiki.info` file needed to start up a server.
If a server directory is already present the function performs no action.

This function is async so should be called `await twServerInit()` to wait for the initialization process to be completed.
