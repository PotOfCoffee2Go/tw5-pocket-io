## Cases

Optionally can purchase a case and heatsink.

There are kits which provide heatsink, adapter plugs and cables, power supply, and case. Do not really need all that stuff, but if planning on experimenting with the zero for hobbyist projects would be a good investment.

This kit also has the most common adapters included.

The ["flirc raspberry pi zero 2w case"](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=flirc+raspberry+pi+zero+2w+case&crid=3739XH537JC5G&sprefix=FLIRC+Zero+case%2Caps%2C325&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_4_15) is an inexpensive case with built in heatsink. I have not used this case but has been highly rated by other people on the web.
