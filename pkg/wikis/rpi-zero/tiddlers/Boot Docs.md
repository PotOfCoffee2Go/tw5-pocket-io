## Booting

Place the SD card into the Zero and plug the power or data port into a powered USB port. If the green light does not come on - try a different USB port. A USB 3.0 port is recommended.

After about 20 seconds the green light should stay on solid. I used the host name 'rpiwikis' with user 'tiddlywiki'.
