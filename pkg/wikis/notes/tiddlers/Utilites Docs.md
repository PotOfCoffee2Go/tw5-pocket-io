## Handy Utilites

### micro editor

By default the system will have an editor called 'nano'. It works in a pinch but uses unfamiliar control keys. The [micro editor](https://micro-editor.github.io/) uses standard ctrl-z,c,v,q, etc keys. Is easier to use. 

When surfing the web and see 'nano' in instructions, just use 'micro' instead.
