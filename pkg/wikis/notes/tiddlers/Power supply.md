## Power

For use as a TW Wiki Host there will be no devices plugged into the Zero as all communication will be over the local network via WiFi. For this application, the Zero can be powered by a <<selectTab power--403293053 "USB Ports" "USB 3.0 port">> - which are pretty standard now-a-days.

The Zero has been designed to power the stuff you plug into it. So generally would want to use a 5V - 2.5A <<selectTab power--403293053 "Power Supplies" "power supply">> to power the devices that are being hung off of it - cameras, sensors, peripherals, and such.

<<tabs "[tag[power]]" "USB Ports" "$:/state/tabs/power" "tc-horizontal">>
