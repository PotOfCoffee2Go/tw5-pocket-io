The @@color:aqua;wikis@@ directory contains all of the 'server' edition ([[WebServer|https://tiddlywiki.com/static/WebServer.html]]) wikis in the network.

To add a new wiki, in a terminal window from the package directory use the TiddlyWiki command that creates a 'server' edition wiki:

```
tiddlywiki ./wikis/MyWiki --init server
```

The wiki name (in this case @@color:aqua;MyWiki@@) is determined by extracting the name from the directory path. The name is used throughout the system. Is displayed to users and also used in JavaScript objects to reference the wiki.

> Note!!
> The name @@color:red;can not contain any spaces@@. This is by design. Spaces complicate the crap out of getting the wiki name from the directory path - can require quotes, double-quotes, double-quoted quotes, or quoted double-quotes to accept the spaces. Depending on the OS, command shell - is just a mess.
> 
> So spaces are not allowed - underbars and dashes are fine.

You can copy an existing 'server' edition wiki into the 'wikis' sub-directory. Rename the wiki removing any spaces if necessary.

Restart TW5-Node-Red 'npm start' and the wiki will be added to the network.

TW5-Node-Red will automatically add some tiddlers (a marco and plugins) needed to interface to the system. By default the new wiki will run without credentails. To implement credentials see [[Credentals|gettingstarted-docs-credentials]].
