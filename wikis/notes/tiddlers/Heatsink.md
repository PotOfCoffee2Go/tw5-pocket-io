## Heatsink

A heatsink is not required but will extend the life of the processor.

I put a heatsink on my Pis but some don't have a case - just set the down and let them run. 

This [case/heatsink combo](https://www.amazon.com/eleUniverse-Raspberry-Aluminum-Heatsink-Compatible/dp/B0BLTZKKN9/ref=sr_1_6?crid=37SEY36MBMEAO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.pATBcA8ckcSgmHSPSTJf7964yZ5tFMTwpo6pP3VdHvlxpUcPSIuhbezPBlVUWl8Gkx9Zk18b-Mjr4WOPmJukCXoGfHEHoG-wgai-5V9YdTgFgs9I8xq8BMtjriPaP8JqDfME9Y0Uv-edhKJLVYVTJKm5s74xrbYcxowZZnIxi4llqDIDsnrlCl4f2NENH4zxKVf2Z1sOWrYZ8koXFbmLmYXYVzPBWOmivQflguqpUWU.FnFORtF7klqsFJCQjKxgb0I_hbonEw5IMjx_8-Frt5o&dib_tag=se&keywords=rpi+zero+heatsink&qid=1729780514&sprefix=rpi+zero+heat%2Caps%2C364&sr=8-6) has worked well for me.
