There are other shorthand helper functions.

The code of the system is loaded from the code wiki on startup.
which has the 'cog' and 'dog' functions defined among many others.

Let's go to the $cw code wiki in a browser and take a look.
If using the default settings the wiki is at 'http://localhost/3001'

In the list of projects - click on 'startup' then click the 'helpers' tab.

To see the same code here in the REPL enter: cog('startup-helpers')

Next: cog('REPL-MOTD-MSG-3')
