The code wiki contains tiddlers with the JavaScript code that is loaded and run by the TW5-pocket-io server. Code tiddlers are loaded similar to [[modules|https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules]] on Node.js but there are exceptions as the code is loaded into a Node.js REPL for execution. Is akin to loading code into a browser. See the [[Introduction Manual]].
