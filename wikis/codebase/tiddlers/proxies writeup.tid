The system starts 'server' edition Node.js [[WebServers|https://tiddlywiki.com/static/WebServer.html]] on localhost (usually ports 8082-8084). 

The Webservers can be accessed directly on localhost by going to http://localhost:8083 which runs a TiddlyWiki Webserver on Node.js as usual out-of-the-box.

There are corresponding [[proxy|proxies]] servers which allows adding routes, for example; a REST interface to the standard TiddlyWiki web requests. The proxies can also operate as middleware which monitors or pre-processes requests to the TiddlyWiki Webserver.

The proxies also provide the  [[websockets|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket]] based [[pocket.io|https://github.com/WebReflection/pocket.io#readme]] interface to the wikis in the server `./wikis` directory.

The proxies are based on [[express|http://expressjs.com/]] server running [[http-proxy|https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy#readme]] middleware.
