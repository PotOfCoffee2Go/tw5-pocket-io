First, would like to acknowledge the patience of the TiddlyWiki community as I have been developing the TW5-Node-Red application over the past months (years?). But finally coming to fruit - with something am happy with.

The goal is to have wikis interact with in Node-Red in a simple manner:

`node-red image`

This project has been years in the making, and is finally coming to fruit.

I also would like to note that I develop code much the same way I write children stories. There is no predefined master plan, characters, story, or plot. Instead just start writing - and do it daily. Let the story, characters, and subplots unfold in the process of the writing. In code, it is functions, interfaces, and user GUI's. So many false starts, the ability to identify and trash hours of work, to make it 'just right' - takes time :(

My TW5-Node-Red project has been going thru that process. Instead of attempting to describe how it works, will show images of the app startup - which gives an idea of what it does. This project will finaaly become the 'tw5-node-red' project upon initial release.
